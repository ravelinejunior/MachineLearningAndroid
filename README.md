#MAIL

The MAIL app (yes, it's a pun on AI and ML) is an email application simulator made in Jetpack Compose to explore machine learning and Artificial Intelligence capabilities on Android with Kotlin.

## üî® Project features
The base project has 3 main screens:
- Home tab: List of emails in several languages.
- Email content: When clicking on an item in the initial list, the screen with the body content and subject appears.
- Adjustments: At first it only contains the text stating that there is nothing there.

At the end of the course, our project will be able to:
- Identify the language of each email through local and offline processing.
- Offer the possibility of translating more than 50 languages, providing access to potentially billions of users.
- Allow the management of ML Kit language models, enabling early download and deletion by the App user when necessary.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

The techniques and technologies used for this are:

- `Jetpack Compose`: Modern toolkit for creating UIs on mobile devices
- `Kotlin`: programming language
- `Gradle Version Catalogs`: new way to manage plugins and dependencies in Android projects
- `Material Design 3`: design pattern recommended by Google for creating modern UIs
- `Hilt`: dependency injection
- `Navigating with Compose`: navigation between composables and screens
- `Viewmodel and states`: screen state management
- `Kotlin Datetime`: navigation between composables and screens.
- `ML Kit identification`: library for language analysis and identification, part of Google's machine learning toolset
- `ML Kit translation`: library for language analysis and translation, part of Google's machine learning toolset
